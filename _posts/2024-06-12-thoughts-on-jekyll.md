The initial installation of Jekyll for self-hosting was not as straightforward as I had hoped. However, following [Tremo's tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1RYsmOMPLs&t=333s) significantly simplified the process by using Github pages.

Mastering markdown and understanding how to fully customize this template will undoubtedly take some time. Despite this, I'm finding the experience enjoyable and rewarding so far!
