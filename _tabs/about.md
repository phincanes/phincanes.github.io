Hey there! I'm Antonio, a tech enthusiast who loves tinkering with gadgets and systems. Over the years, I've built a solid self-hosted platform that revolves around Synology, Ubiquiti gear, Proxmox virtual machines, and containers, with multiple Docker nodes to keep everything running smoothly.

My setup includes Ubiquiti networking equipment for top-notch connectivity, Synology NAS devices for reliable storage, and Proxmox to manage virtual machines and containers. I've also got a few Docker nodes handling various services, making everything work seamlessly together.

I enjoy finding innovative ways to optimize tech setups and make them more efficient. If you're looking to enhance your home network, integrate smart devices, or need some friendly advice on your tech projects, I'm here to help. Let's dive into the world of tech together and make your setup as awesome as possible!
